This KWin Script extends the quick tiling functionality in KDE. It adds four shortcuts which behave similarly to the cinnamon desktop tilin system.
This script is a fork of https://github.com/tsoernes/kwin-quick-tile-2 made by Torstein Soernes with refactored source.

Tested and compatible with multi-monitor setups.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/diegobr89/kwin-cimon-tiler && cd kwin-cimon-tiler
```
_or_ [download the zip](https://github.com/diegobr89/kwin-cimon-tiler/releases) and extract it.

2. `cd` into the `kwin-cimon-tiler` folder.

3. Execute the following command in the `kwin-cimon-tiler` folder:
```
sh install.sh
```
4. Open `KWin Scripts` from the start menu and enable Cimon Tiler.
## How to use
Default keys are <Meta + Arrow>, for example <Meta + Up>, as in Windows 10, where the Meta key is also known as the Super key or Windows key.
If the keys are already bound, you need to set them in "Global Shortcuts" from the start menu. The shortcuts are prefixed "Cimon Tiler".
They are usually to be found in the KWin shortcut tab, but on some systems they end up in the System Settings tab.

Afterwards, you might need to log in and out.
